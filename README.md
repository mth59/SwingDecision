Two things are in this repository: 

1. My basic R code to generate the swing decision plots.
In order to generate the plots for a unique count, there are 3 places in the code to change the count to the desired count.
Then, for the chosen count, a plot is generated for each player on the team with all of their swings from this past fall. Each pitch is scored, and there is a score table at the bottom. 

3. An example of one players swing decision plots
